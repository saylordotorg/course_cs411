**Unit 3: Genetic Algorithms** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we start with an overview of genetic algorithms.  Then,
we show a practical example of genetic algorithms that demonstrate the
application of event classification and feature selection.  Also, we
show a video about computational systems that have been used for natural
selection on complex artificial problems.*

     Instructions: Watch this video on computational systems that have
    been used for natural selection on complex artificial problems. 
    There have been some successes, but the complexity of artificially
    evolved systems remains short of the complexity one easily finds in
    biology.  You may benefit from viewing certain sections of this
    video more than once; repeat watching any sections of the video that
    are hard to follow.  It may also help to take notes as you view this
    video.  This should take approximately 2 hours of study time.
