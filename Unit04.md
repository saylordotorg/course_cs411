**Unit 4: Computation in Cellular Automata: Selected Review** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In the first part of this unit, we provide the description of one
dimensional cellular automaton and study some rules by which cellular
automaton evolved.  Then, we will discuss some properties of the regular
language sets generated by a finite number of steps of cellular
automaton evolution.  Also, we show Stephen Wolfram's classes of
cellular automaton behavior.  Next, we show the standard cellular neural
network model and its potential applications.  In the end of the unit,
we will study complex systems, such as living organisms, the brain,
society, the economy, etc.  Complex systems are part of computer science
and a computer scientist invents algorithmic processes and formulates
suitable abstractions to model complex systems to predict its behavior. 
Complex systems depend on a huge number of details making them nearly
irreducible, so that they cannot be described in terms of a small number
of variables. *
