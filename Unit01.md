**Unit 1: Review: Theory of Computation** <span id="1"></span> 
*In the first part of this unit, the student will learn about
representing information, the concept of languages, the notion of
programs, and the concept of non-determinism. Then, we will get an
overview of the mathematical systems of finite-state transducers and
grammatical characterizations of the languages that finite-memory
programs accept.  The last part of the unit covers the mathematical
systems of Turing transducers.  Also, we will discuss the relationship
between determinism and non-determinism in Turing transducers.*

     Instructions: Read the introductory webpage titled “General
    Concepts."   Then, click on the hyperlinks for each section 1.1-1.5,
    and read each webpage in its entirety.  From this reading, you will
    learn about strings and the role that strings have in representing
    information.  This reading relates the concept of languages to the
    notion of strings and introduces grammars for characterizing
    languages.  Also, this text deals with the notion of programs and
    the concept of non-determinism in programs.  This reading covers
    subunits 1.1.1 through 1.1.3 of this course.

    mathematical systems of Turing transducers as a generalization to
    pushdown transducers.  In section 4.2, you will learn about the
    relationship between the general class of programs and Turing
    transducers.  Section 4.3 considers the relationship between
    determinism and non-determinism in Turing transducers.  Section 4.4
    shows the existence of a Turing transducer, called a universal
    Turing transducer, which can be programmed to compute any computable
    function.  This reading covers the topics outlined in subunits 1.4.1
    through 1.4.4 of this course.
