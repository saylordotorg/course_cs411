**Unit 2: Molecular Computation** <span id="2"></span> 
*The first part of this unit covers the structure and manipulation of
DNA for computational purposes.  Then, we discuss the development of
biocomputers and biologically derived materials to perform computational
functions.  In order to understand biocomputers better, we list some
elementary concepts and building blocks of supramolecular chemistry. 
The last part of the unit shows a video about the workings of a DNA
computer.  *
